# Contributing to Font Famous

Before adding any new logos to this repo please [create an issue](https://github.com/jsdelivr/FontFamous/issues) first (follow the protocol below). Font Famous was made specifically for **media** brand logos.  Suggesting to add any other type of logo would be counterintuitive.

#### Good Logo Category Examples
* Magazine
* TV News Program
* Radio Show
* Podcast
* Newspaper
* *Popular* Blog or Review Site

#### Bad Logo Category Examples
* Blogs that just launched
* Sports Team (including fan sites)
* Symbols of random objects

## Protocol for submitting a Logo Request
1. Make certain the logo / media outlet falls within the accepted category AND that is not already requested. If you aren't sure, just ask. If it already exists, simply comment that you'd also like to see it made.
2. Create an issue for each logo individually (avoid grouping multiple logos into 1 request).
3. Title the issue as "Logo Request: /media outlet name/" & tag/label it as "Logo Request"
4. Include a URL to the outlet and a sentence on why it should be included.
5. Include a link to an SVG logo, or the highest version if no SVG is available.
